This is the basic introduction to Variables in Javascript.

A variable in JavaScript is like a storage box used to hold data that can be used and manipulated later in your program. Think of it as giving a name to a piece of data so you can easily refer to it instead of rewriting the data multiple times.

Key note about Variables:

1. Purpose: Variables are used to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a program.

2. Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you donâ€™t need to specify the type of data a variable will store (e.g., string, number, etc.).

3. Readability: Variables improve code readability by using meaningful names for data instead of hardcoding values.

Why do we need variables?

1. Reusability: Store values that can be reused multiple times.
2. Flexibility: Uodate values as your program runs
3. Abstraction: Replace hardcoded data with descriptive names.

How Variables work:

1. Declaration: Telling javscript that you want to create a variable.
2. Initialization: Assigning a valye to the variable (Can be done during or after declaration)
3. Usage: Using the variable to retrieve its stored value
